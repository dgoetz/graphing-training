    name=grafana
    baseurl=https://packagecloud.io/grafana/stable/el/7/\
      $basearch
    repo_gpgcheck=1

      https://grafanarel.s3.amazonaws.com/RPM-GPG-KEY-grafana
    sslverify=1
    sslcacert=/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt

Install Grafana:

    @@@Sh

# Grafana Server

Start and enable the Grafana server:
